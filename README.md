Created this videogame that consists of defeating some aliens with your spaceship.  

It's very easy to understand, but I'll leave the instructions below  

## How to play 📑  

You can find the steps to **download and run** the game at  [SpaceGame](https://github.com/sami-sopas/SpaceGame/releases/latest)

The game contains 3 levels with different difficulties, the objective is to defeat all the enemies.  

The ship controls are:  
* **[W]** Up
* **[S]** Down
* **[A]** Left
* **[D]** Right 
* **[Left and Righ Arrow]** Shoot
* **[Up Arrow]** Special Shoot

You can only use the special shoot when it is at 100%. This charges up every time you shoot an enemy.  


if you lose, the game restarts and you'll have to try from the beginning.  

Every time you clear a level, you recover a bit of your stats so you can keep fighting.
